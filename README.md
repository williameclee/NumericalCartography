# Numerical Cartography

This repository contains the code for the numerical cartography project. It contains some basic functionalities to create lighting effects on a 3D terrain model. The code is written in MATLAB and with a CPU-based approach.

## Demo

Try to run the demo of the function `shadow.m`:

```matlab
shadow('demo')
```

It will generate a simple 3D terrain model with a light source and a shadow.

## Functions

- `grainynoise`: Adds a grainy noise to a normal map.
- `hillshade`: Computes the hill shade of a 3D terrain model with various Lambert models.
- `normal`: Computes the normal vector of a 3D terrain model.
- `sampledem` and `sampledem2`: Generate sample 3D terrain models.
- `shadow`: Computse the shadow of a 3D terrain model with a light source.
